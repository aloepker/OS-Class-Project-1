What to do:

To compile, enter the directory, type "make" in the shell/terminal.
Then run the program oss.
The program oss must be run with options selected:
-n <number>   :this sets the number of processes to launch, default is zero.
-s <number>   :this sets how many processes can run at once, efault is zero.
-t <number>   :this sets the number of loops each worker performs, default is zero.
Example:
./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 3

 
All previous issues have been addressed and corrected. This program is in it's final form.


Issues encountered durring development:
Had some trouble with execl initially.
I also had some diffaculty implementing the loops that correctly controlled the number of workers and how many at a time.
All in all, this project was a good refresher on the concepts.
