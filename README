description of how to compile and run the project ,

any outstanding problems that need to be addresed,

probablems encountered allong the way, I guess a log of updates kinda..




MUST USE VERSION CONTROL WITH GIT!!!

The task:

write a makefile that compiles 2 programs at once, oss and worker (use 'all' command)
worker is launched from within oss variably as needed



suggested steps:

x1. set up git repo  --  DONE!

x2. create makefile and barebones source files to make sure it atleast complies  --  DONE!

X3. create the code to parse options and recieve the comand parameters. review getopt  -- DONE!

x4. fine tune worker taking in options and looping with output  --  DONE!

x5. Fine tune oss to use fork() and exec() off one worker to "work" and wait() will done  --  DONE! 

6. fine tune oss to keep forking off workers until the parameter specified --  Current

7. fine tune simultaneous restriction (?)

8. testing, correct readme with usage statement. include git history/version control log

9. before submitting, perform: make clean and keep the latest source checked out in your directory

10. change directory to loepker.1 and set permissions with : chmod 700 loepker.1
   and: cp -p -r loepker.1 /home/hauschild/cs4760/assignment1
resubmissions are ammended as loepker.2 and so on
