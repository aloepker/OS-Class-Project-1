// this program takes in one command line argument like:
// ./worker 5

// the number passed in becomes the number of iterations performed on a loop

//each pass through the loop: output the pid, parents pid (ppid),& current iteration of the loop
//looks like it needsoutput the above w/"before sleep", sleep for 1s, and output the above again w/"after sleep"

// I think tha tis it! no shared memory right now, hurray! will not be called, but can test directly
